Rudhira referring to blood, in sanskrit is an app developed by the team Fourier Transform as a part of the hackathon. This app aims at providing an interface for blood donors and reciepients who are in need of urgent blood.

The app allows people in need of blood to send a request for the blood needed with their contact details. A donor who wishes to donate blood will be able to see all these requests and will be able to donate to them.

More features which include:
-> A donor's side for the app, where they can donate blood to whom they can donate. Once donated, the request will get deleted from the database.
-> A donor's pofile which will include all his contact details.
-> A tab connecting IITG- Hospital for blood donation details to make it easier for donors and reciepients.
